# webgl2-object-transformations

This project demonstrates object transformations and camera movements using the [WebGL2 framework](https://webgl2fundamentals.org/). The code is written in JavaScript, except for the shader handling, which is written in GLSL (GL Shader Language, essentially C/C++ code).
