# webgl2-object-transformations

This project demonstrates object transformations and camera movements using the [WebGL2 framework](https://webgl2fundamentals.org/). The code is written in JavaScript, except for the shader handling, which is written in GLSL (GL Shader Language, essentially C/C++ code).

If you decide to download and give this project a run, I suggest you run it in a Firefox browser for the best visual experience. However, Chrome is also supported.

To run, simply navigate to this (root) folder after download, and run the [index.html](https://github.com/stela-kucek/webgl2-object-transformations/blob/d3fcd92ed7b89200f05663929217c8c251edac5d/index.html) file in your browser.

The result should look something like this:
